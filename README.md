## Requirements

### Docker

This application is intended to be run in a Docker container to ensure consistency across environments.

Docker can be installed from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Build the Docker container:

```
npm run docker:build
```

Run the application in `development` mode:

```bash
npm run docker:dev
```

### Testing

To test the application:

```bash
npm run docker:test
```

Tests can also be run in watch mode to support Test Driven Development (TDD):

```bash
npm run docker:test:watch
```

### npm scripts

All available npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

## Service-to-service authentication

This service optionally attaches a short-lived JWT to every outbound request to the backend API. This is disabled by default and intended to be enabled in deployed environments when the backend has `SERVICE_AUTH_ENABLED=true`.

When enabled, the service obtains a JWT from the AWS STS `GetWebIdentityToken` API on startup, caches it in memory, and refreshes it automatically before it expires. The token is attached as a `Bearer` header on all backend requests.

The AWS SDK reads the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` environment variables automatically — these are injected by ECS and do not need to be set manually.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required when enabled | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVICE_AUTH_ENABLED` | ✅ | Set to `true` to enable. Default: `false` |
| `SERVICE_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | optional | JWT audience sent in the token request — must match the backend's expected audience. Default: `fcp-mpdp-backend` |
| `SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN_DURATION` | optional | Token lifetime in seconds (max 900). Default: `300` |
